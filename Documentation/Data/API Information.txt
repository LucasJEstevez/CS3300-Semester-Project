API Information/Documentation (information from https://apidocs.marketcheck.com/):

- From where and how frequently is this data gathered and refreshed?
As mentioned above we gather this data from internet by crawling dealer websites. We also provide private party and auction listings. These are crawled daily, so the data is refreshed every 24 hrs. But the data in API backend is only updated once a day around 11 AM UTC.

- What is a listing? how are they inserted, updated and expired?
When a vehicle is listed online for sale at a dealership, we create a record for it in our system, we refer to it as one listing. The details of a listing are gathered from source websites search result page and that vehicles details page. We insert a new listing when we see a new vehicle on a source / website, and in subsequent crawls that same listing is updated if we continue to see it online on target site.

- When there is change in price of the vehicle / listing, we create a new record / listing in our system and the old listing that we had been updating is then expired.

- Listings also expire when they are sold or go offline.
