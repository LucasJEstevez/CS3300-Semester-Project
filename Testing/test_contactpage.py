"""
This test case was created mostly by using a template from ChatGPT, which was then modified to work with this specific feature case
Before running any test, open a terminal and change the working directory to the project root (CS3300-Semester-Project) and run: pip install -r requirements.txt
Then, run the test by running (in the same open terminal): python -m unittest -v  Testing.testing
