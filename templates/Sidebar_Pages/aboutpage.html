<h1>About</h1>

<p>Welcome to 1-Stop Car Shop! This free software combines “all present market listings” (simulated data) for new and used cars onto one website (by means of a large, 
    constantly updating database of cars) with recently sold car prices included (if applicable) and provides a way to have your car’s price estimated instantly. Save time 
    by using the functionalities of our web service, rather than finding each function of the service on a different site!
</p>

<h2>Why 1-Stop Car Shop?</h2>

<ul class="custom-list">
    <li>On automobile shopping sites, of which there are many, browsing is tedious as listings are not shared</li>
    <li>Many options exist for sites to use when pricing (or getting an offer for) an existing car</li>
    <li>Generally little to no information on recently sold vehicles (i.e. price, most recent sale location)</li>
</ul>
