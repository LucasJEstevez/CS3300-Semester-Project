<h1>About</h1>

<p>Welcome to 1-Stop Car Shop! This free software combines “all present market listings” (simulated data) for new and used cars onto one website (by means of a large, 
    constantly updating database of cars) with recently sold car prices included (if applicable) and provides a way to have your car’s price estimated instantly (with the help of MarketCheck’s Price Predictor API). 
    Save time by using the functionalities of our web service, rather than finding each function of the service on a different site!
</p>

<p>This web service was created mainly as a team-based class project for CS3300 at the University of Colorado Colorado Springs by Computer Science students John Camargo, 
    Jackson Seales, Kylie Sanchez, and Lucas Estevez</p>

<h2>Why 1-Stop Car Shop?</h2>

<ul class="custom-list">
    <li>On automobile shopping sites, of which there are many, browsing is tedious as listings are not shared</li>
    <li>Many options exist for sites to use when pricing (or getting an offer for) an existing car</li>
    <li>Generally little to no information on recently sold vehicles (i.e. price, most recent sale location)</li>
</ul>
